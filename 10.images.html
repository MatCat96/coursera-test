        a quote"> &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how
        the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have
        done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually
        in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
        who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again,
        because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who
        does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasm,
        the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy
        cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
        achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails
        while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
        cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.&quot;
